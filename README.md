# RISCV-64 SIMULATOR

A simple simulator simulating basic instructions of riscv64 assembly. The purpose of this simulator is being able to
simulate the code for Vox language I have implemented a compiler for.

## Supporting instructions
- Integers and string literals
- Some 64 bit operations
- Some branching
- Call stack and function calls
- Registers
